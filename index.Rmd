# Preface {-}

This is a very early draft of a book setting out practical techniques for actuarial work
that I have picked up over the years.

The main topics are expected to be:

* [Data visualisation](#data-viz)
* [Linear algebra](#lin-alg)
* [Fitting statistical distributions](#dist-fit)
* [Applying statistical goodness-of-fit tests to distributions](#stat-tests)
* [Techniques for working with overlapping data](#overlap)
* [Dependency structures and aggregation techniques](#dep-agg)
* [Proxy modelling](#proxy-modelling)
* [Operational risk modelling](#op-risk)
* [Equity release](#eq-rel)

At the time of writing almost all the content is missing or (at best) in very early draft.
It is surpassingly unlikely that links to this content from external websites
will survive the development and editing process.

A companion R package [`practechniques`](https://github.com/PaulMTeggin/practechniques)
is in development. This will contain functions and data to support the content in this book.
